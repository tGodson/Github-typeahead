# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is based on creating a Github typeahead without using a prebuilt drop-down component. Rather, the Github api and swr.vercel.app is used for data fetching and displaying the user name and profile photo of Github users on the typeahead. The typeahead is like a vector graphic and everything scales as the viewport increases or decreases in size. Create-react-app is used to bootstrap the project.
